Context: I am coding my way through deep learning history using just numpy to improve my understanding of AI

This is a cutomizeable multilayer RNN that I have coded from scratch using numpy (no Pytorch or Tensorflow)
The model can be trained on any corpus
Queries to the model will generate text
As this project is moreso for my understanding, my final implementation (found in the testying.ipynb notebook) has not been rigorously trained - but is still capable of generating text
